# Convert Greta output data to the CLRTAP template

The Greta software, operated by UBA Germany, produces gridded emission from the national emission statistics. The output files need to be transformed slightly to fit the CLRTAP gridded emission template (see https://www.ceip.at/reporting-instructions/annexes-to-the-2014-reporting-guidelines - Annex V). This conversion can be performed with the code offered here.
